About Me

Hello! My name is Wim Barelds, I live in Groningen (Netherlands) and have been doing web development since my teenage years during the early 2000's- most of that time not professionally though.

In that time I've done a bit of everything; at first just plain HTML with a lot of <table>s, then a dash of CSS; some PHP, MySQL, later adding javascript, learning Java, and C# before specializing in what I discovered I like most: frontend development.

Ive worked on small projects, big projects, large team, small team solo; websites, portals, applications, browser extensions, games, concepts, animations, VR, 2D, 3D, etc. All in the browser of course.

I hope to share some of niftier examples of this here.

Modern frontend frameworks:
[React, Angular, Vue, Solid, Vanilla]
Over the past years I've worked on mid to large projects in with React, Angular, Vue and Vanilla. I've generally used VueJS for personal projects, but I've recently dove into SolidJS- which has been very refreshing.

Serverside rendering etc:
[SSR, ISR, Pre-render, SPA, MPA, Next, Nuxt, SolidStart]
Over the past years I've worked and experimented with most of all the different rendering technologies available in modern frontends. However, many of the projects I work on also don't really need it or benefit from it, and conventional single-page-applications still very much have their place.

Styling:
[CSS, SCSS, CSS Modules, CSS-in-JS, Tailwind, Styled Components, SolidStyled]
Despite all the advancements in frontend over the past years, our CSS tools have remained fairly stable. My favorite setups in this area at the moment are SCSS in VueJS single-file-components, or SolidStyled.

Backend/Content:
[Rest, GraphQL, Groq, Firebase, Sanity, IndexedDB, SQL]
Where does content come from? Traditionally probably an SQL server somewhere- either rendered directly through Java, C#, PHP or served via REST. These days things are more flexible, content-structures have become more flexible with headless content systems and getting that data has improved with tools like GraphQL, Groq and tRPC.

Testing:
[End-to-end, unit testing, cypress, playwright, mocha, jasmine]
I have experience with most different types of testing, but I generally prefer end-to-end testing via tools like Cypress or Playwright- as this very quickly and effectively highlights integration issues; without having to write tests that completely lock the application down. Of course, unit tests also have their place- though I often find them more useful to ensure code curently works than to ensure it doesn't break in the future.

Build:
[Vite, Rollup, Webpack, Grunt, Gulp]
I have experience with most modern build tools out there, though I admit to not having played around with turbopack; and admit I never liked Webpack very much.

Misc
Websockets, svg, canvas, Node, Express
typescript, javascript, php, java, c#
