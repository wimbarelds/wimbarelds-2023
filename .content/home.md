## Who is Wim Barelds?

[tag: Professionally]
I am a senior frontend software developer from the Netherlands (Groningen).
My biggest strength is finding creative and elegant ways to solve problems.
Sometimes that leads me to reinvent some wheels, and though sometimes that's
not really needed, it does give an excellent understanding of how wheels work.

[tag: Personal]
I also enjoy gaming; primarily single player story driven RPGs, and
as a fallback for when I've completed those- games like minecraft or League
of Legends. I have on occasion also built some simple games myself, when
I do- I'll share them here.

And finally, I love climbing. I used to climb trees, but these days I do
top-rope climbing and bouldering. I _can_ also do lead climbing, but I enjoy
it less. I probably won't post any climbing content here though... Probably.

## Traits

* Analytical
I can generally analyze a problem quickly and figure out what chokepoints
there are; what questions need to be answered and what things need to be made.

If a solution exists or is suggested, I'll generally be able to point out
whether it is possible, solves the problem and where the complexities will
arise.

When working on a larger problem, I can easily divide it up into smaller
parts that can be tackled separately. If different problems have overlap
that can benefit from a shared solution, I tend to find that overlap and
conceptualize a scalable solution.

If there are steps in an established process that can be optimized, I will
find those steps; make a case for optimizing them and implement improvements.

* Creative
As an engineer, I don't like repeating a manual task a hundred times; I'd
much rather automate that process. Creative solutions however does more than
save time, it also reduces the risk of human error and generally makes for a
happier developer or colleague.

However for me, creativity is much more than a tool towards reliability or
productivity. I also quite enjoy doing less 'useful' things like coding
challenges and experimental things.

That mighty not always be immediately useful; but it educates, it inspires,
it shares passion and it helps discover solutions that might later actually
be useful.

* Versatile
I have been in software developmenmt a long time; I've been doing it at some
level since I was about 8 years old. I'll go a bit more in depth on that under
history, but suffice it to say- I've been exposed to a lot of concepts and
programming languages in that time.

Though I am currently most versed in frontend development, among other things I
have at some point dabbled in backend development, databases, 3D rendering,
desktop applications, native, mobile apps, assembly/embedded software, machine
learning, browser extensions, build tools... The list could go on.

Even if narrowing that scope though, I have experience with React, VueJS,
Angular, SolidJS, Polymer, jQuery and of course vanilla.

Granted, software development is a big place; there's probably things in your
stack that I haven't used before. All of the tools and technologies that I have
worked with before help me learn new things quickly.

* Educator
Not only do I still really enjoy learning new things, I also very much enjoy
taking the time to explain topics to other developers. I also tend to share my
excitement and passion about the topics I explain, which helps to also keep
the audience engaged.

Beyond that, perhaps the most important aspects of teaching are understanding
and patience. I generally have a good intuition for which aspects of a topic
are, and are not yet properly understood, which elps to explain those areas
more thoroughly.

Finally, I am patient in my explanation and because I enjoy teaching and have
a good understanding of what the difficulties of a topic may be- I also come
across as less intimidating, someone who junior developers feel they can ask
a question and won't judge them.
